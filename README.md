# SENTIMENTAL-ANALYSIS-ON-TWEET-DATA-WITH-NLP-TECHNIQUES
### This project outlines a structured methodology for conducting sentiment analysis or related natural language processing (NLP) tasks, emphasizing the critical stages of dataset loading, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, word cloud visualization, and model building. The process begins with the acquisition and organization of a dataset, specifically Twitter tweets, followed by rigorous data cleaning procedures to address any issues such as missing values or noise. Exploratory data analysis provides valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics and identifies patterns that inform subsequent preprocessing steps.
### Text preprocessing is a pivotal phase where raw text undergoes transformation through techniques like tokenization and stemming, preparing it for analysis. The project employs word cloud visualization to present a concise overview of the most prominent words in the dataset, facilitating the identification of prevalent themes or sentiments.
### The final stage, machine learning algorithms or deep learning architectures are applied for sentiment analysis, culminating in the creation of an application model using the Streamlit package. This application model serves as a practical tool for analyzing sentiments in text data, providing users with an intuitive interface to interact with the sentiment analysis functionality. Through the utilization of Streamlit, the model becomes accessible and user-friendly, enhancing its usability and applicability in real-world scenarios. This project offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to text data analysis, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners engaged in sentiment analysis or similar applications. The outlined framework ensures a robust and standardized methodology, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of sentiment analysis projects.
### The programming environment utilized for this project includes Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code, with a minimum Python 3.9.13.
